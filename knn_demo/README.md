# Supervised Classification using KNN ‚Äì Demo

This is a simple demo project for supervised classification using the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm with Python and scikit-learn.

## üìå Overview

The project demonstrates how KNN works in classifying data points based on their neighbors. It includes:

- Data preprocessing (normalization, splitting)
- Model training with KNN
- Evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report)

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- matplotlib / seaborn (for visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional)
